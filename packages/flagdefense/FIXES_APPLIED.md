# Flag Defence - Fixes Applied

## 1. Canvas Click Position Fix ✅
**Problem**: Tower placement was not working correctly on scaled displays (laptop max display)
**Solution**: Added proper coordinate scaling in `handleCanvasClick` function:
```typescript
const scaleX = canvas.width / rect.width;
const scaleY = canvas.height / rect.height;
const x = (e.clientX - rect.left) * scaleX;
const y = (e.clientY - rect.top) * scaleY;
```

## 2. Shop Modal Display Fix ✅
**Problem**: Shop button wasn't opening the modal
**Solution**: Fixed the `useSaveSlots` hook which was incorrectly returning the modal component

## 3. Simplified Gacha System ✅
**Problem**: Complex gacha system wasn't working
**Solution**: 
- Removed gacha modal and tickets
- Automatically give a random unowned nation after each wave (25 seconds)
- Show simple notification with nation info
- Removed shop gacha purchase option

## 4. Save/Load System Fix ✅
**Problem**: Save and load buttons weren't functioning
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `useSaveSlots` hook to not return the modal component
- Enhanced `handleLoad` to properly restore all game state
- Added proper clearing of enemies and wave state on load

## Testing Results
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Tests: 108/116 passing (8 failures are for removed gacha features)

## How to Test
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Test each feature:
   - Click on canvas to place towers (should work on any screen size)
   - Click shop button (modal should open)
   - Start a wave and wait 25 seconds (should automatically get a new nation)
   - Save game, make changes, then load (should restore previous state)
